  My name is Ahmet Kağan Hançer. I am 14 years old and living in Qatar. I am a muslim and Turkish. I am complating my education in<a href="http://debakeyatqatar.org/">Michael De Bakey Middle School Qatar</a>. I lived in Turkey until 2019.<br />
  After that year, I moved to Qatar to learn English. Because to don't know English was a big barier in front of me to learn new things. I love science. Until 10 years old, I was interested in<br />
  astronomy. 10 to 12 biology and chemistry, and now mostly Quantum mechanics, chemistry and physics. As my hobbies, I am doing wood carving, jevelery (polishing and finding gemstones), Calligraphy<br />
  (both Arabic and Lathinic) and was playing violin. And I am learning photography, graphic design and photoshop. Also as my works, I am learning computer sciences, math and my school lessons.<br />
  I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBVjdhfSvjyGGQn3ACLzkuA">youtube channel</a> that I upload videos about my different hobbies.<br />
